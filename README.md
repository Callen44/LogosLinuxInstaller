# LogosLinuxInstaller
LogosLinuxInstaller is a bash script for installation of Logos Bible on Linux using AppImage.

Just make it executable and run.

You will get:
1- One AppImage folder in the home of your user.
2- One Wine Bottle ".wine32" in the home of your user.
3- One executable on the Desktop of your user, to start the application installed.

NOTE: It will use the wine from AppImage. But it will not change the installation of your system.
