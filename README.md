# LogosLinuxInstaller
> LogosLinuxInstaller is a bash script for installation of Logos Bible on Linux.

#####* NOTE The v2.0 will break backward compatibility. It will work like the portable version, with variations that may or may not use AppImage, depending on the user's choice, but all installation alternatives will maintain some isolation from the rest of the system and other installations (the independent directory can be moved/renamed without losing functionality) .

### * New, more detailed and better instructions are being made for the new v2.0 and higher.
